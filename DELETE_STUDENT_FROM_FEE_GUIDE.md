# Delete Student from Fee Functionality

## Overview
This feature allows administrators to remove students from fee eligibility lists, providing better control over fee management.

## How It Works

### 1. Delete Button Location
- The delete button (ðŸ—‘ Remove) appears in the Actions column of the payment details table
- Only visible to administrators
- Only shown for students who haven't made any payments (paid amount = 0)

### 2. Safety Measures
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm the deletion action
- **Payment Check**: Students with existing payments cannot be removed
- **School Verification**: Only students from the admin's school can be removed
- **Loading State**: Button shows "Removing..." during the deletion process

### 3. API Endpoint
- **Method**: DELETE `/api/fee-eligibility`
- **Body**: `{ classFeeId: number, studentId: string }`
- **Response**: Success/error message

### 4. Business Rules
- Students can only be removed if they have made zero payments for the fee
- The system prevents accidental removal of students with payment history
- Removal is permanent and cannot be undone
- Page automatically refreshes after successful removal

### 5. User Experience
- Clear visual feedback with toast notifications
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Disabled state during processing
- Helpful tooltip explaining the remove function

## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations
1. Verify admin permissions and school context
2. Check if student has any payments for the fee
3. Delete the `StudentFeeEligibility` record
4. Return success/error response

### Frontend Components
- `PaymentDetailsClient.tsx`: Main component with delete functionality
- `AddStudentsToFee.tsx`: Modal for adding students
- `fee-eligibility/route.ts`: API endpoint handling DELETE requests

### Error Handling
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Payment validation before deletion
- School context verification
- User-friendly error messages

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to a fee's payment details page
2. Find the student you want to remove (must have $0 paid)
3. Click the "ðŸ—‘ Remove" button in the Actions column
4. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
5. The student will be removed and the page will refresh

## Benefits
