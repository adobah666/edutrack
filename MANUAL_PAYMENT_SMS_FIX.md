# Manual Payment SMS Fix

## 🔧 **Issue Fixed**
Added SMS notifications for manual payments made by admins through the fees section, ensuring consistent communication regardless of payment method.

## ✅ **Changes Implemented**

### 1. **SMS Integration in Manual Payment API**
- Updated `src/app/api/student-fees/route.ts` POST endpoint
- Added SMS notification after successful payment creation
- Uses same enhanced message format as Paystack payments

### 2. **Consistent Payment Experience**
- **Paystack Payments**: SMS sent automatically ✅
- **Manual Admin Payments**: SMS sent automatically ✅ (Fixed)
- Same message format and balance information for both methods

### 3. **Smart Balance Calculation**
- Uses existing `totalPaidAmount` calculation
- Shows remaining balance or full payment confirmation
- Consistent with Paystack payment messages

## 📱 **Message Examples**

### **Manual Partial Payment**
```
Payment confirmed for John Doe at Greenwood Academy. 
Amount: GHS 500 for School Fees. 
Remaining balance: GHS 1000 of GHS 1500. 
Thank you!
```

### **Manual Full Payment**
```
Payment confirmed for John Doe at Greenwood Academy. 
Amount: GHS 1500 for School Fees. 
Fee fully paid (GHS 1500). 
Thank you!
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Student Data Retrieval**
```typescript
// Get student with parent information and school details for SMS
const studentWithDetails = await prisma.student.findUnique({
  where: { id: studentId },
  select: {
    name: true,
    surname: true,
    phone: true,
    school: { select: { name: true } },
    parentStudents: {
      select: {
        parent: { select: { phone: true } }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### **Balance Calculation**
```typescript
// Calculate remaining balance after this payment
const remainingBalance = classFee.amount - totalPaidAmount;

const paymentMessage = SMSService.getPaymentConfirmationWithBalanceMessage(
  studentName,
  amount,
  studentFee.classFee.feeType.name,
  studentWithDetails.school.name,
  remainingBalance,
  classFee.amount
);
```

### **Smart Phone Routing**
```typescript
// Get all phone numbers for the student (student + parents)
const phoneNumbers = SMSService.getStudentPhoneNumbers(studentWithDetails);

// Send SMS to all available phone numbers
for (const phone of phoneNumbers) {
  await SMSService.sendSMS(phone, paymentMessage);
}
```
