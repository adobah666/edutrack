# Payment Security Implementation Guide

## 🔐 Overview

A comprehensive password verification system has been implemented to secure manual payment operations in the school management system. This prevents accidental payment recording and deletion by administrators.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. **Partial Payment Support**
- Students and parents can now pay any amount up to the remaining balance
- Custom amount input with validation
- Quick payment options (Full Amount, Half Amount)
- Real-time amount validation

### 2. **Admin Password Verification**
- **Manual Payment Recording**: Requires admin password verification
- **Payment Deletion/Reversal**: Requires admin password verification
- **Two-Step Process**: Prevents accidental operations
- **Online Payments**: Paystack payments remain unaffected (no password needed)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Environment Variables
```env
# Admin Payment Verification Password

```

### API Security
- **POST /api/student-fees**: Validates admin password for manual recording
