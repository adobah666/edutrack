## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Real-time Filtering**
```typescript
const getFilteredRecipients = () => {
  const allRecipients = getAllRecipients();
  
  if (!searchTerm.trim()) {
    return allRecipients;
  }

  const searchLower = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
  
  return allRecipients.filter(recipient => {
    // Search by recipient's own name
    const fullName = `${recipient.name} ${recipient.surname || ''}`.toLowerCase();
    const nameMatch = fullName.includes(searchLower);
    
    // For parents, also search by their children's names
    if ('parentStudents' in recipient) {
      const childrenMatch = recipient.parentStudents.some(ps => 
        ps.student.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)
      );
      return nameMatch || childrenMatch;
    }
    
    return nameMatch;
  });
};
```

### **Smart Selection Logic**
- **Filtered Selection**: Select/deselect only applies to current search results
- **Persistent Selection**: Previously selected recipients remain selected even when filtered out
- **Auto-clear Search**: Search resets when changing recipient type

## 📱 **Usage Examples**

### **Finding a Specific Parent**
1. Select "Parents" recipient type
2. Type "Mary" → Shows parents named Mary
3. Type "John" → Shows parents of student John + parents named John

### **Finding Students by Class**
1. Select "Students" recipient type  
2. Type "Grade 5" → Shows students with "Grade 5" in their class name
3. Type "Smith" → Shows students with surname Smith

### **Bulk Selection**
1. Search for specific group (e.g., "Grade 3")
2. Click "Select All Filtered" 
3. Clear search to see all recipients
4. Previously selected Grade 3 students remain selected
